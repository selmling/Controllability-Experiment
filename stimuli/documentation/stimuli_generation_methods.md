#### Pink noise

- 1 / f noise (Mandelbrot): under spectral analysis power spectrum inversely proportional to frequency, power decreases with increasing frequency

- Laplace randomness is fluctuations around the mean, does not apply to things like rain amounts to the river Nile

- Turbulence (unruly cloud) fluids are turbulent too though, airplanes

#### Create pink noise in Adobe Audition

- New audio file, mono, 44100 Hz, 32 bit depth

- Effects > Generate > Noise

	- Color > Pink

- Roll off the unnecessary low end with EQ (below 60 Hz) set a highpass filter -24dB/Oct at 60 Hz

- Set it to the duration needed for the trials (3 mins, 15 sec in our case)

- Fade in the volume at the beginning (fade in lasts for 15 seconds)
